creating unnecessary or deep inheritance hierarchies



1) we have a queue of n integers, called 'theArray', carrying integers from 1 to n.
2) we need sum of first n integers, for this we need to add all the integers present in 'theArray'. 
3) the only way to do this is to use sumOfAll() method, as we can't access theArray directly, it is private.
4) sumOfAll() takes out first two integers from the queue, adds them, then attach the result at the end of the queue.
5) but it takes 1 sec to do the above mentioned process
6) it keeps doing this until there is only one integer left in the queue, which is the sum of all integers.
7) Therefore if there are n integers in theArray then the sumOfAll() method will take n-1 secs because it takes 1 sec to add every two integers. 
8) so if there are 1000 integers in theArray(), sumOfAll() will take 999 secs, which is very slow and time consuming.
9) to make this faster, we use 10 threads, to call sumOfAll() method 10 times simultaniously. 
10) So instead of doing one addition every second, we will be doing 10 additions every sec.
11) 10 threads will be doing the job of a single thread.

1) select 100 tourist places subreddit.
2) for any place => % of positive posts, % of negetive posts
3) What are the most common things/nouns (key words) these positive posts talking about. List them to user.
4) What are the most common things/nouns these negetive posts talking about. List them to user. 
5) clicking on a keyword will fetch posts that have that keyword.
6) Recommend other places whose positive reviews contain a similar set of keywords.  
7) update the entire snetiment analysis periodically, so that the user will always see the current status or the current issues of the tourist place.
