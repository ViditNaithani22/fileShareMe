<h4>Once you login, you will see your home screen. Now you can upload your files. As soon as you upload a file it will generate a link, which you can share with your friends. Using this link your friends can download your file. If your upload a .txt file, then two links will be generated. the first one will be to download the original file and the second one will be to download the compressed version of this file. The .txt files are compressed using the Huffman file compression algorithm. There is also a delete button beside every generated link, which you can use to delete your files.</h4>

<h2> How it works </h2>

<h4>First we create a Node.js environment by installing the following packages:</h4>
<h4>üçÅ Express: it handles routing and server side logic, allows us to create methods that analyze the user's request and respond to them accordingly</h4>
<h4>üçÅ mongoose: helps us to access our MongoDB database</h4>
<h4>üçÅ multer: helps us to create the functionality of uploading, saving and downloading files</h4>
<h4>üçÅ ejs: instead of using html we will use ejs as we will be using various if-conditions inside our html code</h4>
<h4>üçÅ bcrypt: used for crypting passwords before storing them in our database</h4>
<h4>üçÅ dotenv: to store multiple environment variables like server port and database url</h4>
<h4>üçÅ nodemon: automatically refresh our server everytime we make changes</h4>
<br>
<h4>Open the terminal inside the folder of your project and run the following commands in the terminal to create this environemt:</h4>
<h4>npm init -y (starts the default node environment and creates package.json file)</h4>
<h4>npm i express mongoose multer ejs bcrypt dotenv (installs all the above mentioned packages and updates the "dependencies" section of the package.json file)</h4>
<h4>npm i --save-dev nodemon (installs nodemon)</h4>
<img width="396" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-25 145504" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/91143fb0-ee06-470d-aeea-0530ec8b45c3">
<h4>Inside package.json file, in the "scripts" section we add: "devStart": "nodemon server.js", this tells nodemon to restart the server as soon as we update the server.js file </h4>
<h4>To run the server we just write "npm run devStart" in the terminal</h4>
<br>
<p>The server.js file contains all the express methods to handle all the server side logic. The index.js file carries the home page which user sees upon visiting the website.</p>
<p>Since we have "type": "module" in our package.json, we can't use require() method to import express package or any other package in the server.js file (eg: const express = require("express") ). We need to use import statements like: import express from 'express'; </p>
<p>Once we have imported express, we can use express() method to get an object which has various useful methods like get(),set(),post(), etc. We store this object in app: const app = express();</p>
<p>The 'views' folder contains our ejs pages. index.ejs shows the home screen and password.ejs shows the screen when user is supposed to type in a password to access a file</p>
<p> Inside index.ejs, in the form tag we need to mention enctype="multipart/form-data" because this form is going to handle not just text inputs like emails and passwords, but also files, which needs to be submitted in multiple parts. Each input in the form is connected to its label via id (in the label tag the value of 'for' will be the same as the id) and it will be refrenced by the methods in server.js by its name value</p>

<p>A method in server.js refrencing password input by using it's name value which is 'password'</p>

<h4>How to upload files?</h4>
<img width="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/2a7a08f2-8555-4e1b-b6ff-94aca1bc01e9"> 
<p>inside the server.js file, we call multer() method, provided by the multer library, and in the argument we specify the folder name "uploads" where we save all of our uploaded files. This returns an object which we then store in a variable called upload. Now we can use various methods provided in the multer library using this object whenever we want to upload a file in the uploads folder.</p>
<img width="458" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/a93a6484-cca4-4531-b624-bfad93a04db6">
<p>In the image above, we use upload.single("file") method to tell that we want to upload a single file at a time. Once this post method is called, inside the uploads folder we will see a new file saved with a randomly generated unique name.</p>
<img height="80" width="303" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/0f6a28a8-2ed9-4797-83da-2a24e49e52c7">
<h4>How to set up port to access the mongodb database and the server output</h4>
<p>We will store the url/port of our mongodb database and server in the dotenv file. To access variables defined in the dotenv file inside our server.js file, we need to first import the dotenv library and then call its config() method</p>
<img width="209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/e6ec4080-7fbf-48e7-b45e-7b3fa60853a0">
<p>Then we use mongoose's connect method to connect to our mongodb database, and we use app.listen() method to specify the port to display the server output</p>
<img width="209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/36e0dab3-cdd3-49d5-a179-0bc0724f1e5d">
<img width="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/60e47be4-d3ad-4e57-8444-968326d1f0c5">
<p>The variables mentioned as the arguments to these methods are defined in our .env file, which is then made private for security reasons</p>
<img width="392" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/7321717a-b649-4dfb-a6c9-97a4842a417e">
<p>Inside 'models' folder we store the entities that we need to store in our database. In this project we need to store the information about our users and the information about the files uploaded by them. Therefore we have two .js files in our models folder File.js and User.js</p>
<img width="128" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/463a9728-649a-42d3-b3cf-9dfff31eacb0">
<p>Inside File.js we import mongoose library, as we need to use it's method to store a file's data in our mongoDB database. We use mongoose.Schema() method, which returns an instance of the Schema class. In this method we pass an object as an argument, where we define the properties or attributes of this File entity which we need to store. So the instance returned by mongoose.Schema() is our table and the attributes defined inside the the object we pass as an argument are the columns of that table. These attributs are variables of type String, Int, Float, Boolean, etc. Then we pass this Schema instance as an argument to another mongoose method mongoose.model('File', FileSchema), where the first argument is the name with which we want to address this instance in our database. This method returns a model class, which we store in a variable, and then we export this variable, so that we can create instances of this model class using this variable in other .js files such as server.js</p>
<p>For a File we will store its original name, its path to the uploads folder, its password (if any), its download count, and the user's name who uploaded the file</p>
<img width="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/f6d61637-f263-4ce3-87ff-7d7e92da7786">
<p>For a User we will store username, password, email, links to download the files uploaded by the user, and the number of files uploaded by the user</p>
<img width="410" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/e6f48e72-755e-4d93-8ad2-e72c46479597">
<p>Note: We are using these two lines: const File = mongoose.model('File', FileSchema); export default File; because we have "type": "module" in our package.json file, otherwise we could have simply used module.exports = mongoose.model('File', FileSchema); </p>
<p>To use the exported File class in our server.js we use the line: import File from './models/File.js'; instead of const File = require("./models/File.js") because we have "type": "module" in our package.json file</p>
<p>The following is the express post method that we use to submit the form data to upload a file:</p>
<img width="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/96e0e942-ee8e-46ef-a34a-7ccbdd6eefbc">
<img width="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/ViditNaithani22/fileShareMe/assets/102232954/41440b1f-2118-4869-ab4f-c831a729bdeb">
<p>The first thing we do in this method is to check whether the user who used the form is authenticated or not. If they are not authenticated, then they are again redirected to the home page without any further processing. If the user is authenticated, then we create a new object called fileData. We create three variables inside it: path, originalName, and username. The mehtod upload.single("file") helps us to address the uploaded file data as 'file' and it also saves the file in the uploads folder. So we can use req.file to access the file's path and name. We use req.user to access the user's data who was just authenticated by req.isAuthenticated() method. Besides the file data, there is also a password box taking in string input. To access that we use req.body. So we first check if the password value is null or empty string. If both the cases are not true, then we create a new variable inside our fileData object called password and store the entered password inside it. But before saving it we use bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10) method to convert it into a random 10 digit number. Then finally we create an instance of the File class using File.create(fileData) method which used the data of the fileData object. This mehtod adds a new file in the database along with a unique id. </p>
