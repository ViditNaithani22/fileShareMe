<h4>🍁This is a file sharing website which covers all the important concepts of backend web development.</h4>
<h4>🍁You can upload files and can generate password protected links to download those files which you can share with your friends.</h4>
<h4>🍁You can also compress any text file (.txt) using Huffman file compression algorithm.</h4>
<h4>🍁The website was made using Node.js and Express.js. The database used is MongoDB. And it is hosted on AWS EC2 using PM2</h4>

<h2> How it works </h2>

<h4>First we create a Node.js environment by installing the following packages:</h4>
<h4>🍁 Express: it handles routing and server side logic, allows us to create methods that analyze the user's request and respond to them accordingly</h4>
<h4>🍁 mongoose: helps us to access our MongoDB database</h4>
<h4>🍁 multer: helps us to create the functionality of uploading, saving and downloading files</h4>
<h4>🍁 ejs: instead of using html we will use ejs as we will be using various if-conditions inside our html code</h4>
<h4>🍁 bcrypt: used for crypting passwords before storing them in our database</h4>
<h4>🍁 dotenv: to store multiple environment variables like server port and database url</h4>
<h4>🍁 nodemon: automatically refresh our server everytime we make changes</h4>
